# py_media-copy
A lightweight alternative to tools like Rapid Photo Downloader

This tool is mainly orientated on my [media-copytool](https://github.com/flolilo/media-copytool), which I created because none of the existing Digital Asset Management (DAM) programs (to my knowledge) offered the options for importing fiels from media cards that I wanted (see [Features](#features)). The goal is to provide a faster implementation with at least feature parity to media-copytool. Note that the goal is not to recreate the code, but the features.

**Note that as of now, this tool is not even finished in a rough state - I am still in the progress of writing the main features and testing them.**

## Features:
 - Will work on all OSs that are supported by [Python â‰¥ 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
 - Optimised for copying large quantities of mission critical files, e.g. wedding photos:
   - Checking CRC32 of every file after clearing the disk cache, thus reducing the risk of a bad copy
 - Lightweight,
 - Standalone binaries (i.e. `py_media_copy.exe`) available,
 - Highly granular controls:
   - Use one or multiple source and/or target path(s),
   - Rename files while copying them (magic strings available!),
   - Create subfolders (magic strings available!),
   - Filter files to copy -- inclusion & exclusion possible,
 - Option to avoid overwriting existing files by searching iterations of the name that are not yet used,
 - Option to avoid duplicates based on:
   - a history file (user specified [JSON file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Example)),
   - duplicate files in the input folder(s),
   - duplicate files in the target path.
 - Option to prevent the device from going to sleep (likely by using a built-in version of [espresso-python](https://github.com/piedar/espresso-python)).
 - Proper documentation *(or so I hope ;-)*


## Details:
 - Small ~~Qt5 GUI~~ [PySimpleGUIWeb (Remi)](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/PySimpleGUIWeb) for the parameters,
 - Standalone planned / as little extra dependencies as feasible (and all on [`pip`](https://pypi.org/)) with decent usability (planned at the moment: [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) required, [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama) recommended, [crc32c](https://github.com/ICRAR/crc32c) if desired) for "source" installation (i.e. not using the binaries, but the script file itself).
 - (Smart) renaming options for files and subfolders: [Strftime magic strings](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior) (e.g. `%Y-%m-%d` for `2019-11-31`)
 - Redundancy checks against history file / target-folder / multiple inputs
 - **Checksum-/hash-based verification of copied file**
 - Include/exclude by regex pattern(s) (e.g. `.*\.jpg` - [see my regex101.com example for what this does](https://regex101.com/r/0WHdUL/2))


## Installation:
**This will probably change once this repo is in a working state. At the moment:**

```sh
# get the repository:
git clone https://github.com/flolilo/py_media-copy.git
cd ./py_media-copy

# create virtual environment, activate it:
python -m venv ./.venv
<Powershell:> & ./.venv/Scripts/activate.ps1
<sh:> source ./.venv/bin/activate

# install requirements:
python -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt

# run py_media-copy:
python ./py_media_copy.py
```

## Milestones:
See the [TODO file](./TODO.todo).
