# py_media-copy
A lightweight alternative to Rapid Photo Downloader

This should become an alternative to Rapid Photo Downloader, mainly orientated on my media-copytool.

## Features:
 - Small Qt5 GUI only for the parameters
 - No extra dependencies except from python - PyQt5 is needed for the GUI, but you can also run purely via terminal!
 - (Smart) renaming options for files and subfolders
 - Redundancy checks from multiple inputs
 - Redundancy checks against history file / target-folder
 - **Checksum-/hash-based verification of copied file**

## Milestones:
See the TODO file.
