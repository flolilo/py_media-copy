=============
py_media-copy
=============

A lightweight alternative to tools like Rapid Photo Downloader

This tool is mainly orientated on my `media-copytool <https://github.com/flolilo/media-copytool>`_, which I created
because none of the existing Digital Asset Management (DAM) programs (to my knowledge) offered the options for
importing fiels from media cards that I wanted (see `Features`_). The goal is to provide a faster implementation with
at least feature parity to media-copytool. Note that the goal is not to recreate the code, but the features.

**Note that as of now, this tool is not even finished in a rough state - I am still in the progress of writing the main
features and testing them.**

Features
--------

- Will work on all (desktop) OSs that are supported by `Python â‰¥ 3.5 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_,
- Optimised for copying large quantities of mission critical files, e.g. wedding photos:
- Lightweight,
- Standalone binaries (i.e. ``py_media_copy.exe``) available,
- Highly granular controls:
    - Use one or multiple source and/or target path(s),
    - Rename files while copying them (magic strings available!),
    - Create subfolders (magic strings available!),
    - Filter files to copy -- inclusion & exclusion possible,
- Option to avoid overwriting existing files by searching iterations of the name that are not yet used,
- Option to avoid duplicates based on:
    - a history file (user specified `JSON file <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Example>`_),
    - duplicate files in the input folder(s),
    - duplicate files in the target path,
- Option to prevent the device from going to sleep (likely by using a built-in version of
  `espresso-python <https://github.com/piedar/espresso-python>`_),
- Proper documentation *(or so I hope ;-) )*


Details
-------

- Small `PySimpleGUIWeb (Remi) <https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/PySimpleGUIWeb>`_
  for the parameters,
- Standalone planned / as little extra dependencies as feasible (and all on `pip <https://pypi.org/>`_) with decent
  usability (planned at the moment: `tqdm <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm>`_ required,
  `colorama <https://github.com/tartley/colorama>`_ recommended, `crc32c <https://github.com/ICRAR/crc32c>`_ if
  desired) for "source" installation (i.e. not using the binaries, but the script file itself),
- (Smart) renaming options for files and subfolders:
  `Strftime magic strings <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior>`_ (e.g.
  ``%Y-%m-%d`` for ``2019-11-31``),
- Redundancy checks against history file / target-folder / multiple inputs,
- Checking CRC32 of every file after clearing the disk cache, thus reducing the risk of a bad copy,
- Include/exclude by regex pattern(s) (e.g. ``.*\.jpg`` - see `my regex101.com example <https://regex101.com/r/0WHdUL/2>`_
  for what this does).


Installation
------------

**This will probably change once this repo is in a working state. At the moment:**

.. code-block:: Shell

    # get the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/flolilo/py_media-copy.git
    cd ./py_media-copy

    # create virtual environment, activate it:
    python -m venv ./.venv
    <Powershell:> & ./.venv/Scripts/activate.ps1
    <sh:> source ./.venv/bin/activate

    # install requirements:
    python -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt

    # run py_media-copy:
    python ./py_media_copy.py


Contribution
------------

You do not even need to be have an GitHub account to report issues - simply mail to
`py_media-copy@fire.fundersclub.com <mailto:py_media-copy@fire.fundersclub.com>`_. (It will *not* publish your mail
address or name!)

Please add as much information as possible - e.g. the used OS, Python version, pmc version, where the error occured,
what the error is, ...

For all versions < 0.99.x, please see the `TODO.rst file <./TODO.rst>`_ - it may be that your issue is already seen as a
milestone.

**Any help would be appreciated!**
